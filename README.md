### About Codewars
Codewars is an online tool for learning code by completing coding challenges. It is similar to Leetcode or Hackerrank in this respect.

The challenges / Kata start at level 8kyu and work up to level 1kyu. 
**So the Lower the level number the harder the challenge**

The Users / Codewarriors also start at Level 8kyu and work up level 1kyu and then on to master / dan levels. 

>Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment.

### Note
These solutions have been written while learning to code and are not always the most efficient ways of solving the problem. I have left them unchanged as it allows for an interesting view of personal growth and development
